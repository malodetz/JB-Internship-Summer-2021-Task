# JB Internship Summer 2021 Task: Fine-tuning ML4SE models for a specific project

For the pipeline represented in Jupyter Notebook to work correctly, you need to :

1. Clone the [code2seq](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq) repository
2. Copy notebook into it
3. Replace the *preprocess.sh* and *code2seq.py* files in the root folder with the ones presented here. 
4. Also create a *sources* folder in the root, where to put the folders with projects from the test part of the [java-medium dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2seq/datasets/java-med.tar.gz).
5. Extract a [models](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2seq/model/java-large/java-large-model.tar.gz) to a root folder of cloned repo.

**Note:** Execution of first two code cells in Jupyter Notebook is too long
